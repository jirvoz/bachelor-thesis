\chapter{Introduction}
Performance of operating system is crucial, because it can significantly affect all the applications running above it.
When a regression in new version occurs, business applications can be even financially affected.

Scheduler was simple. Multi-core CPUs made the scheduler little more complex, but those complications were tuned through time.
Next milestone was introduction of multi-CPU machines with separated memory for each physical unit.

Compared to functional testing, performance isn't evaluated as true/false result, but relative change to previous measurement.
Due to this complexity is hard to use common tools for inspecting performance.
The biggest regression in scheduler doesn't hide in uneffective code, but in wrong placement of processes to cores and it's queues.

The usual testing method is simulating load simmilar to real usage.
To achieve this there are many benchmarks targetting different types of load, usually many parallel process, sometimes communicating between each other.

Good performance tests usually create great amount of data, which is required to be processed, aggregaed and visualised.

\chapter{Specification}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get acquainted with the existing methods for measuring performance of the Linux kernel scheduler and with means of storing of benchmarks results for further processing.
\item Study possible ways of processing these results with a focus on graphic interpretation and on methods for detection of performance degradation.
\item Design and implement a method for efficient graphic interpretation of long-term measurements.
\item Design and implement a method for automatic detection of performance regression.
\item Demonstrate the functionality of your implementation on at least two versions of the Linux kernel.
\item Evaluate the obtained results and discuss possibilities of further development of the project, especially of the automatic detection of performance regression.
